            Mechanical engineering is an engineering discipline that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles
             with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.[1] It is one of the oldest
              and broadest of the engineering disciplines.
              <br>

            The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics,
             dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles
             , mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing
              (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial 
              equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, 
              robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.
              <br> It is the branch of engineering that involves 
              the design, production, and operation of machinery.[2][3]
            
            Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe 
            in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world.
             In the 19th century, developments in physics led to the development of mechanical engineering science.
             <br>
              The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in 
              such areas as composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. It also overlaps with aerospace engineering, metallurgical 
              engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, manufacturing engineering, chemical engineering, industrial
              of biomedical engineering, specifically with biomechanics, transport phenomena, biomechatronics, bionanotechnology, 
              and modelling of biological systems.

            <p>The application of mechanical engineering can be seen in the archives 
                of various ancient and medieval societies.
                <br> The six classic simple machines
                 were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp)
                  were known since prehistoric times.[4]
                  <br> The wheel, along with the wheel and axle 
                  mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC.[5] The lever
                   mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale,
                   [6] and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology.[7] 
                   <br> The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting 
                   device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC.[6]
                   <br> The earliest evidence of pulleys date 
                   back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC.[8]</p>
